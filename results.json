DO NOT change pose, position, or composition.\n\nCRITICAL - NEVER CHANGE (from Image 1):\n- Character's EXACT body pose, arm positions, leg positions, head tilt, body angle\n- Character's EXACT position in the frame (where they are standing/sitting)\n- Background, scene, environment - must be PIXEL PERFECT same\n- Camera angle, framing, composition, crop\n- Lighting and shadows\n- Composition\n\nSWAP ONLY these visual features FROM Image 2:\n- Face shape and facial features\n- Hair color, style, and length\n- Clothing appearance (colors, patterns, open/closed state of clothes eg: jacket open vs closed, style)\n- Visible accessories (jewelry, glasses, hats, etc.)\n\n- Facial expression fix: Adjust eye gaze to look downwards, tilt head down slightly, shift facial expression to a speaking concerned look with an open mouth, and change hair color to dark brown.\nThink of it like a costume change on the EXACT same character pose. The silhouette and position should be IDENTICAL to Image 1.\n\nOutput: Image 1 with ONLY the character's visual appearance changed to match Image 2. Pose and composition UNCHANGED.",
